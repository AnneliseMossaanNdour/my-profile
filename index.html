			<h2>I live only for the Sun and heat</h2>
				<p class="text-justify">My daily driving force is the sun and the warmth that comes with it. It gives me energy, good humour and follows me like a faithful friend. Having lived almost all my life in Dakar (Senegal), how could it be otherwise. I don't know what the future holds for me, but I know it will be in a warm country. PS: Please take me back to summer.</p>

			<h2>Multiples passions</h2>
				<p class="text-justify">Dear reader, I don't think you expected this when you came to my site but I am a grandmother. Yes, my favourite hobby has been sewing for a long time. Apart from that, I am an unconditional lover of series, books and music. And of course coding ! Haha</p>

			<h2>Un unconditional love for holidays</h2>
				<p class="text-justify">If there's one thing I love more than anything, it's holidays. To get away, to discover new places, to take your mind off the daily grind is an indescribable feeling that I don't think I'll ever get tired of. What more beautiful moment than when you don't do anything intellectually demanding, you just take care of yourself and that's incredible.</p>

			<h2> A passionate traveller and discoverer</h2>
				<p class="text-justify">I still don't know exactly what I want to do with my life, but if there's one thing I'm sure of, it's that I'm going to do everything I can to combine work and travel. I feel at home in the most exotic places.Which completely explains the previous link.</p>
